Exercise 1: Basic Singleton Implementation
Objective: Implement a basic Singleton Pattern.
Steps:
Create a Logger class that follows the Singleton Pattern.
Ensure only one instance of Logger is created.
Add a method log(String message) to log messages.

Exercise 2: Thread-Safe Singleton
Objective: Implement a thread-safe Singleton.
Steps:
Modify the Logger class to make it thread-safe.
Use the double-checked locking principle to ensure thread safety.
Demonstrate logging from multiple threads.

Exercise 3: Lazy Initialization
Objective: Implement Singleton with lazy initialization.
Steps:
Create a DatabaseConnection class that follows the Singleton Pattern with lazy initialization.
Ensure the instance is created only when needed.
Add a method connect() to simulate database connection.

Exercise 4: Singleton with Enum
Objective: Implement Singleton using an enum.
Steps:
Create an enum Configuration that follows the Singleton Pattern.
Add methods to set and get configuration values.
Demonstrate setting and getting configuration values.

Exercise 5: Serialization and Singleton
Objective: Ensure Singleton property during serialization.
Steps:
Create a Settings class that follows the Singleton Pattern.
Ensure the Singleton property is maintained during serialization and deserialization.
Demonstrate serialization and deserialization of Settings.

Exercise 6: Singleton and Reflection
Objective: Protect Singleton from reflection attacks.
Steps:
Create a Preferences class that follows the Singleton Pattern.
Protect the Singleton instance from being instantiated via reflection.
Demonstrate the protection mechanism.

Exercise 7: Singleton in Multithreading Environment
Objective: Implement a Singleton for a multi-threaded environment.
Steps:
Create a Cache class that follows the Singleton Pattern.
Ensure the Cache class works correctly in a multi-threaded environment.
Add methods to add and retrieve items from the cache.

Exercise 8: Singleton in Dependency Injection
Objective: Integrate Singleton with a dependency injection framework.
Steps:
Choose a dependency injection framework (e.g., Spring).
Create a ServiceManager class that follows the Singleton Pattern.
Integrate ServiceManager with the chosen dependency injection framework.
Demonstrate the injection of ServiceManager into a client class.

Exercise 9: Singleton with Bill Pugh Method
Objective: Implement Singleton using Bill Pugh Singleton Design.
Steps:
Create a ResourceManager class that follows the Singleton Pattern using Bill Pugh Singleton Design.
Ensure thread safety and lazy initialization.
Demonstrate accessing the ResourceManager instance.

Exercise 10: Test Singleton Pattern
Objective: Write unit tests for Singleton implementation.
Steps:
Choose a Singleton class (e.g., Logger).
Write unit tests to ensure only one instance of the class is created.
Write tests to ensure thread safety and correct behavior of methods
